About Lagdown
=============
Lagdown is a blogging system supports markdown, Tex mathematical syntax and code highlight. 

We aim to build a blogging service that belongs to we engineers and mathematician. It's a leisure project after my work, so there is no explicit schedule or plan. Join us if your are interested.

You can check our progress in [milestones](https://github.com/tonytonyjan/lagdown/issues/milestones), or if you have any cool idea, feel to make issues letting us know, thanks a million. =)
